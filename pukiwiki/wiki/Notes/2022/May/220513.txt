# Self Study

## ICC2 Unit3 Appendix

  - ICC Auto-Bounds
  - RP :: Relative Placement
      - Data flow vs Control flow
      - bit-wise :: every bit
      - **bit-sliced** structure
      - RP group :: <span class="underline">tiling</span>
  - Physical Datapath in DC-T/G & ICC II
  - SCANDEF :: file format for Scan chain connectivity information
      - supports reordering within partitions

## ICC2 Unit4

  - New Data Mode NDM Cell Library by ICC II Library Manager
  - clibs :: ICC II NDM cell libraries
      - sources:
          - Logic libraries (.db files)
          - Physical libraries (.frame, LEF and/or GDS files from
            vendor)
          - Technology file
      - contains:
          - <span class="underline">Layout</span>  
            Detailed physical shape information (all layers) with no
            connectivity.
          - Design  
            Physical shape information with connectivity and pins.
          - Frame  
            Minimal physical shape information for P\&R with
            connectivity and pins
          - Timing  
            All cell timing+power information, arcs, attributes, and so
            on
      - created in advance and stored at a central location
      - generated “under the hood” (internally) by IC Compiler II
  - Technology-only NDM
      - Technology file  
        unique to each technology, Defines parametersfor all process
        layers
    <!-- end list -->
      - Read TLU+ models
          - To create TLU+ files (a binary format) you need the itf as
            input to <span class="underline">grdgenxo</span>
  - Placement Sites and Symmetry
      - N row vs FS row  
        North row, Flip South row
      - track offset  
        the distance from the standard cell edge to the center of the
        pin
      - abut  
        隣接する
  - Source File Information, Library Manager
      - icc2_lmshell
  - Automated Cell Library Creation
      - select the PVT parametersfor
          - PVT  
            Power Voltage Temperature
  - PVT Configuration
      - Using PVTconfigurations, you can configurethe exploration flow
        to use only a subsetof the libraries.
  - An aggregate reference library combines separate NDM reference
    libraries

## ICC2 Unit5 Design Setup

  - Design Library  
    "container"
    
      - contains:
          - Technology library
          - standard cell library
          - IP cell library
          - reference library?
      - The first step in data-setup is to create the design library.
      - specify the technology library and reference libraries to be
        used with this design library

  - Technology Information  
    all information in the NDM unit
    
      - contains  
        TLU+, site and routing track information
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
      - routing directions are automatically used:
          - M1, M3, M5, …for horizontal routing
          - M2, M4, M6, …for vertical routing
          - Track offset will be 0 by default.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Rebind a Design Library**
      - Links are never dereferenced, but stored as given (so in this
        case as the symbolic link).
      - you cannot have additional or missing routing layers across
        libraries.
  - possible to read liberty (.db) and frame-only-views (.frame)
    directly

# Webinar

  - stacked chips can be high temperature
  - Integrity DB
  - Integrated System Planning
  - 2.5D vs 3D
      - 2.5D connects chips with interposer
      - 3D really stacks chips
  - Signal Bump Optimization
  - TSV as **Via or macro**
  - NDR :: non-default rule
  - **shielding** pattern :: Shielding is an effective and common
    technique to reduce crosstalk noise as well as delay uncertainty at
    the cost of increased routing area.
