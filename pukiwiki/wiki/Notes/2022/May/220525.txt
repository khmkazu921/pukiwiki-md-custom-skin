# Status Meeting

  - structural report  
    see sink of CTS

  - LEQs  
    rotate, different pin location

  - Freeze Silicon ECO  
    ECO after tapeout half chip

  - Spare cells

  - ECO cells  
    gate arrays for ECO

# DE Tech Meeting

## Genus Physical Takemoto-san

  - Genus Physical yields better than DC Graphical
  - FV :: Formal Verification, Comformal vs Formality

## Innovus Mixed-Placer Takemoto-san

  - Auto-placement for memory macros
  - `place_design -concurrent_macros`
  - worse cell density
  - cell density :: increase because available area decrease
      - area decrease  
        **because of prehibit area; especially near the memories**
    <!-- end list -->
      - High cell density can cause the congestion

### Takashima-san

  - placed like large std cell
  - orienetation does not change considering pin locations

## ICC2 create_placement -floorplan Tsuji-san

  - very fast and good result

## DDR block layout trial Sassa-san

  - Design Check Study \> DDR etc.
  - Internal to I/O ring (inter-ring wire)

## Useful skew Lin-san

  - power recovery  
    remove power of clock network and register

<!-- end list -->

  - usually difficult to remove register power
      - may downsize register

### Tsuji-san

  - margin is better than uncertainty

### Takashima-san

  - thesedays, useful skew is better than zero skew

## IO bump and ball map Ke-san

### Pin list

  - pin list check  
    gets from customer

<!-- end list -->

  - Determine IO cell type
      - PullDown / PullUp ?
      - DRV (drive) simulation :: see drive ability
  - Determine SSO value :: Simultaneous Switching Output, Noise check
      - This apparent shift in the ground potential to a non-zero value
        is known as simultaneous switching noise (SSN) or ground bounce.
  - DEF vs set_signalioconstraint
  - Power connection to bump

### Ball map (excel)

  - ball map is for package vender
  - Bump coordinate :: table for location and connection between balls
    and bumps
      - cordinate origin is center

### Q\&A

  - I/O rule?

## PrimeTime Multi-Voltage Ishii-san

  - Multi-voltage Design
      - Cross Analysis is required because there are multiple voltage
        domain.
      - SMVA :: Synopsys Multi-Vaotage Analysis
  - Scaling :: a group of libraries to support voltage and/or
    temperature scaling
      - Derate Support
      - Library Group
  - Exact Match
      - no interpolation加筆 is allowed

# Self Study

  - Non-metal filler cells  
    connected to PG because they have power and ground rails. **Filler
    cells** vs **spare cells**
    
      - *Filler cells are used to fill the spaces, avoid the DRC spacing
        violations & Power rail continuty*

  - IC Validator  
    DRC check & DRC fixing
    
      - performed on all routing metal and via layers (created by
        router, by user, PPNS)
    
      - `auto_eco` allows to auto find areas with routing DRCs
    
      - `signoff_fix_drc` ICC II router to fix selected signoff DRC
        violations
    
      - Double-pattern DRCs :: GDSII/OASIS
        
          - The full design view may be needed, instead of the frame
            view, when checking DRCs with double patterning, for
            example.
          - GDSII :: runset ?

<!-- end list -->

  - **Metal Fill** Insertion
      - IC Validator remove and insert metal fill on full-chip

## Lab 9 11

  - Crosstalk Prevention can occur in the global routing andthe track
    assign stages.
  - Secondary PG pins are power pins on special cells like *level
    shifters* or *isolation cells*

<!-- end list -->

``` tcl
