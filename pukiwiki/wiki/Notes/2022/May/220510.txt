## MIPI (DPHY) SLVS-EC

  - MIPI  
    Mobile Industry Processor Interface?

  - D-PHY  
    DDR drive

  - SLVS-EC  
    Scalable Low Voltage Signaling with Embedded Clock, difficult to
    obtain data with internal clock

  - AC coupling  
    AC+DCを含む信号からコンデンサを用いてDCを除去する回路 構成

  - PCB wiring  
    insertion loss 減衰, retern loss 反射, EMI

  - 誘電損

  - S-parameter  
    matrix

  - emphasis  
    送信側

  - equalizer  
    CTLE, 受信端イコライザ DFE

## MP of fast ATE test borad (PCB design)

### Policy

  - 対抗デバイス方式  
    system board
  - loopback test  
    BIST, DFT test pattern, no need support from customer

### Layout design

  - impedance, same length

  - ground via

  - impedance mismatch??

  - 誘電体, 誘電損？

  - stub, via stub 作らないように, インピーダンスが低下

  - scratch

  - 伊藤さんは、テスト場合はチップを甘やかす

### SIPI simulation

  - inductor  
    coil, choke, or reactor

### Probe

  - oscilloscope  
    eye diagram

  - D2C skew  
    timimng diff of Data to Clock

  - Shmoo check

# 渡辺くんの授業

  - RC high pass filter
  - Double patterning

# Self Study

## Lab 2

  - There are four macros inside that voltage area are placed on top of
    one another.

  - on top of one another :: 3つ以上重ねて

  - congestion map with line

  - flyline very fast

  - end point ??

## ICC2 Unit 3

### Place opt Exploration Flow (QoR iterations)

1.  place_opt
2.  Analyze congestion
3.  congetsion-focused setup
4.  rerun place_opt

(if accepted)

1.  Analyze timingm power and area
2.  timing-, power- and/or area-focused setup
3.  rerun place_opt

### Pre-placement check

  - Second-Pass synthesis ??

  - Second-Pass Design Setup ??

  - SPG Synthesis :: Synopsys Physical Guidance

  - EMS database :: Enhanced Messaging System, to store checking results

### Design/flow requirement

  - AL  
    Advanced Legalizer
  - MCMM  
    Multi-Corner Multi-Mode, a technique intended to provide high
    confidence results for timing and other metrics without performing
    exhaustive simulation of all possible IC conditions.
  - DEF  
    created using write_icc2files in DC-G,
    write_icc2files command writes the design files and Tcl
    scripts for the current design
  - HF  
    High fanout, HF synthesis / buffering occurs during the
    initial_dre stage
  - Spare cells  
    extra gates which are included in a netlist but are not functionally
    connected and used during the initial design phase.
  - physical-only cell  
    **contain only PG pins or no pins, for example: tap, end-cap, filler
    cells**

<!-- end list -->

  - tap cell??

  - end-cap cell (boundary cell) :: placed at both the ends of each
    placement row to terminate the row

  - set/reset, enable, select signals :: ideal network constraints on
    HFN. They need buffering.

  - Library cell purpose :: such as power, hold, cts, optimization.
    dont_use=true: no purposes

  - Preroute Power Optimization :: leakage, dynamic, total (leakage +
    dynamic)

  - Vt Swapping :: to possibly reduce leakage power further. Algorithm
    exchanges LVT cells with identical RVT or HVT cells,

  - SAIF :: Switching Activity Interchange Format

  - TC :: Toggle Count

  - Tr :: Toggle Rate, tr = default_tr\*fclk,
    
      - default_togglerate (0.1), frequency is 0.25
      - tr = 0.1\*0.25=0.025

  - infer_switchingactivity

  - EPs :: esssential points

  - SCIs :: Special Control Inputs such as resets and enables
