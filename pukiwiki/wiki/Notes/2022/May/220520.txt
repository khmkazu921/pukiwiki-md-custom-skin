### Clock Tree Balancing

  - explicit sink pin with delay  
    apply across corners with scaling delay

<!-- end list -->

  - Scaling?

  - Default Clock Tree Target :: ideal network latencies is changed in
    propagated. So, you should specify target latency to clocks prior to
    CTS : <span class="underline">User-Defined Clock Tree Targets</span>

  - CCD :: The Goal is to <span class="underline">intentionally</span>
    introduce skew to meet timing

  - **Clock Balance Points ??**

  - Automatically-derived clock balance points
    
      - Reference Latency  
        source + network-latency for the clock. To derive the balance
        point delay value, the ideal mode total clock latency at a sink
        is subtracted from the reference latency.

  - Control CTS cell selection :: not only buffers and inverters,
    **logically equivalent cells and FF are resized**

<https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_41464428/article/details/111185699>

### Pre-exisiting Clock Elements

  - Existing cells on clock tree  
    Ensure `cts_libcells` includes LEQs (logically equivalent cells) of
    existing cells and ICGs.

  - Inter-clock Balancing  
    (Synchronous clocks), not performed by default
    
      - CCD try to skew individual sinks instead of the root.
          - This leads to longer runtime & many buffers.

<!-- end list -->

  - By default, any source latency defined on the clocks is ignored,
    when balancing the latencies of the respective clocks.
  - `dont_touch` :: not propagate past FFs downstream,
      - set_donttouchnetworkポイントから下流のFFを越えて伝搬されません
  - **Pre-existing cells** :: must be kept, set `dont_touch`
      - allow sizing vs prohibit moving

### Non-default Routing Rules

  - NDR  
    non-default routing rules, e.g. double-spacing, double-width,
    shielding **to make the clock routes less sensitive to cross-talk
    and electro-migration (EM) effects**
    
      - via optimization is also required
      - Single cut via :: a type of via where we have only one poly
        connection between the two connecting metal layers
      - Replaced with: **Multiple-cut via arrays** and/or **Larger
        square or bar cuts**

  - taper  
    尻すぼみ
    
      - Automatically tapers NDR widths to connect to pins.

<!-- end list -->

  - Large spacing for crosstalk prevention can make routing difficult
      - spacing-length thresholds  
        spacing value is ignored if the parallel length is less than the
        threshold
  - NDR promotion :: Clock Crosstalk Prevention.
    1.  Creating and preparing clone NDRs with the increased spacing.
    2.  Iterative NDR promotion.
  - Necessary to ensure all clock input ports have a slew constraint for
    accurate check
  - Remove skew from uncertainty :: to avoid pessimistic timing analysis
      - Pre CTS uncertainty = clock skew + jitter + margin
      - causes post-CTS skew on output paths to be zero \> Results in
        optimistic setup timing analysis
