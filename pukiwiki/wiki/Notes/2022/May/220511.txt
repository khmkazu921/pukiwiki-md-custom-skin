    importance vs proceeding order

  - HPC  
    High Pin Count device, 多ピンデバイス

  - Strong cells

  - congestion segment labels  
    Capacity (supply): 20 tracks, Overflow: +4 tracks, Underflow (here
    -4) is counted as 0 etc.

  - initial_place  
    not congestion-driven but reducing the overall wirelength

  - GR-opto  
    Grobal Routing Optimization
    
      - buffer placement for HF and DRC-violating nets
      - GR-optp mainly helps on channel-based (macro-dominated) designs
        to ensure that buffering is picking the right channels and not
        overflowing channels in DC-G.

  - CDR  
    congestion-driven restructuring
    
      - CDR untangles the net crossings and eliminates the congestion
      - AOI :: and-or invert logic
      - OAI :: or-and invert logic
      - complex AOI/OAI logic structures can cause many net crossings
      - not supported when using SPG place_opt

  - NVE  
    Number of Violating Endpoints

  - Design Fusion  
    Logic Restructuring for Area and Timing
    
      - Revocer power/leakage & area through restructuring

<!-- end list -->

  - In case of wire length increase, restructuring moves will be
    rejected by default

  - Automatic Timing Control :: Placement focused too much on
    WNS/near-WNS,toolittle on TNS. create additional weighted path
    groups, add move bounds and set net weights.

  - BAP :: Buffering Aware Placement
    
      - improves initial placement by:
          - Estimating the timing of un-buffered long nets and high
            fanout nets
          - Performing timing-driven placement
      - Without BAP, initial placement is wire-length driven

  - Two-pass initial placement flow
    
      - consists of:
        1.  Buffering aware timing-driven coarse placement
        2.  Trial HFNS
        3.  Timing- and congestion-driven placement
      - effective for macro-dominated design
      - a non-SPG flow with two-pass placement may result better
      - Controls : Cell max density / clumping + Congestion-driven max
        utilization

  - Legalization :: **avoid row overlapping**, avoid large displacement

  - Stream Legalization :: multiple small moves

  - ICG :: Integrated Clock Gating Cell, basically stops the clock

  - ICG enable setup timing violation
    
      - \*ICG makes enable signal slower because ICG is driven by input
        clock, but Pre-CTS ICG enable latency is ideally seen as ZERO
        latency.\*
      - ICG optimization :: Trial CTS + ICG splitting + Clock-aware
        placement
      - ICG merging :: always occurs if the enable and clock signals are
        common
      - trial CTS :: provides better guidance for ICG splitting and
        clock-aware placement
          - performed at initial_drc + initial_opto
            + final_place
      - ICG splitting + clock-aware placement :: Smaller ICG downstream
        clock latency \> better ICG enable timing

  - In coarse placement
    
      - cells are not distributed evenly

  - dissipation :: gradually disapearing

### Power/Area

  - average RC is used by default
  - **Two techniques to handle miscorrelation ??**
      - Layer promotion
          - Assigns critical nets to higherless resistive layers
      - Route Driven Extraction (RDE)
          - Computesa statistical model for VR nets based on actual
            global routing data
  - ideal vs
