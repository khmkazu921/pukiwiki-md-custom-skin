        frequency domain, such as you might do with a filter or
        impedance matching network.

<!-- end list -->

  - STA vs SPICE

  - CAとCBの差分の面積がチップサイズの10%以下である必要がある

  - Wire delay :: LSIでは配線のRC遅延が高速化のボトルネックになっている。
    超伝導PTLは抵抗が0なので、遅延はRC遅延ではなくLC遅延であり、つまり光
    の伝搬遅延に等しい。

  - Repeatability
  - Custom Via Mapping Table
      - VL \> VB \> VS
      - VL :: Large square via

      - VS :: Small square via
  - Via optimization rates can be improved by reserving space during
    initial route
      - Reserving space increases routing runtime

        via conversion rate is 80%

          - (antenna-area) / (gate-area) \< (max-antenna-ratio)
      - Gate-area:
          - Boolean AND (orintersection) of the ‘poly’ and the
            ‘diffusion’ layers
          - Recognized as the gate area of the transistors by
            essentially all foundries
      - Antenna-area:
          - Amount of metal area attached to the input pin
          - Calculation method varies for different processes
      - Max-antenna-ratio:
          - Represents max allowed ratio of antenna area to gate area
