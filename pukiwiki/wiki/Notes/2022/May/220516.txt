# Self Study

## ICC2 Unit4 revise

  - N row vs FS row  
    triangles show the power grid porarity

<!-- end list -->

  - **each row has legalized cell rotation**
      - R0  
        Rotation 0 degree
      - R180  
        Rotation 180 degree
      - MX  
        Mirror with respect to X axis
      - MY  
        Mirror with respect to X Y axis
    <!-- end list -->
      - symmetry attribute = X
          - PG arrays are vertically aligned
          - R0 & MX, R180\&MY are the equivalent
      - symmetri attribute = Y
          - PG arrays are horizontally aligned
          - R0 & MY, R180\&MX are the equivalent

## ICC2 Unit5

  - UPF' vs UPF''
    
      - All UPF changes performed by DC are captured in a UPF' file
      - All UPF' changes performed by ICC II are captured in a UPF''
        file

  - Golden UPF flow
    
      - User UPF is preserved as golden UPF (G-UPF)
      - All intent changes captured in supplemental UPF (S-UPF)
      - You can optionally use the Verilog netlist to store all PG
        connectivity information

  - Load a DEF Floorplan File

  - Load the Floorplan

  - Better to ignore unused metal layer to gain accurate congestion and
    STA

  - Load Scan Chain identification information

  - Connect PG Pins to supply nets

  - Enable Tie-high/low cells

  - Pack/Unpack
    
      - When packing:
          - All reference libraries are packed unless you specify
            `-exciude_reflibs`
          - All blocks are packed by default. Use -blocks to pack a
            specificlist of blocks
          - Collections are not packed, you can rebuild them from the
            unpacked design
          - All variables and application options are saved as well
      - When unpacking:
          - opens the library and sets the current block
          - All the referencelibraries are located in the reflibs
            directory under the library
          - Use -destination to specify the destination directory in
            which to unpack the design

  - A design library
    
      - Contains the physical designs saved after various design phases
      - Is always tied to a specific technology
      - Must contain pointers to all referencelibraries

  - When using the Golden-UPF flow, a name mapping file is required,
    because DC or ICC I might change the names of objects that are
    described in the golden UPF file.

  - Tie-high/low cells will be inserted during placement optimization

  - This can be doneeither in Library Manager, during the creation of a

  - Cell placement site and symmetry are defined either in
    "technology-only library” (the recommended approach), or
    alternatively in ICC II, during design setup.

## ICC2 Lab5

1.  setup search_path
2.  ref_libs options
3.  close_libs to reset
4.  create_lib to create design library
5.  load_upf & commit_upf
6.  source floorplan.tcl which is created by write_floorplan
7.  read_def ORCA_TOP.scandef
8.  connect_pgnet & check_mvdesign
9.  set_ignoredlayers -max_routinglayer M6
10. rename_block -to_block
    ORCA_TOP/init_design & save_block or
    save_lib

## question

  - **Physical Only Cell ??**
  - **Ramp up Ramp down**

## ICC2 Unit 6

  - Switching current corner or mode changescurrent scenario

  - Timing constraints :: classified into four categories
    
      - Mode-specific
      - Corner-specific
      - Scenario-specific
      - Global

  - While set_donttouchnetwork is a global constraint command,
    it may be applied to clock objects (which are mode-specific), in
    which case the constraint will be treated as a mode-specific
    constraint.

  - Scenario Constraints
    
      - typically in a single file
      - Contains scenario, modal and comertiming constraints
      - modes and corners :: shareable among scenarios

  - Loading Constraints
    
      - should be loaded only once
