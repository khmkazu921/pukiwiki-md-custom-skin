## ICC II Unit 7

  - GRP  
    Global Route Optimization
    
      - Optimization based on full signal global routing and GR timing
      - In `clock_opt`

<!-- end list -->

  - Clock Tree Levelized Graph

  - ideal :: Prior to CTS, Clock latencies are 0ns, by default

  - propagated :: actual clock network latencies
    
      - input delay remain ideal
      - Only clocks in active scenarios are propagated and get updated
        latencies

  - Caution :: Propagated Clock Object
    
      - `set_propagated_clock [all_clocks]` causes I/O clock latencies
        to 0 because there is no synthesized clock network.
      - solution :: apply set_propagatedclock on clock
        sources: `set_scenario_status -active true [all_scenarios]`
        `synthesize_clock_trees -propagate_only`

  - Auto-Latency Update with Virtal Clock

  - CCD targets <span class="underline">leakage</span> and
    <span class="underline">total</span> power reduction
    
      - Clock Sinks  
        Leaf Cells

  - Timing analysis, optimization and useful skew computation are based
    on propagated clocks

  - Useful skew computations are performed multiple times during
    place_opt final_opto.

  - question
    
    > With budgeted useful skew during CTS, it is easier to tap sinks
    > early, because they can be constructed that way during CTS itself.

## ICC II Lab 7

## ICC II Unit 8

  - Start of CT  
    source

  - End of CT  
    registers or macros

  - Ignore Pins  
    CTS ignores skew and insertion delay targets

  - Explicit Sink Pin  
    allows CTS to optimize skew and insertion delay

  - Explicit delay balance point  
    sink pin with delay
    
      - balance point constraint (with -delay) can be used to manipulate
        the placement of the macro- i.e. move closer to or farther away
        from the clock root.

  - Explicit Ignore/Exclude Pin  
    ignore down-stream sinks for skew balancing

  - Clock Skew Group  
    to balance a group of clock pins independently
    
      - local skew optimization will work on critical endpoints
        <span class="underline">within</span> a skew group - it will not
        work across skew groups.

  - CT balancing conflicts ??
  - ETM :: Extracted Timing Models, like black box
  - case 2, 3 :: Sinkがボックスに囲われていて、どうやっても最適化できない場所
