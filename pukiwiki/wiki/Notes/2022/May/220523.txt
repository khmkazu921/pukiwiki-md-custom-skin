  - LVS :: Layout vs Schematic,
      - While DRC only checks for certain layout rules to ensure the
        design will be manufactured reliably, functional correctness of
        the design is ensured by LVS.

# Self Study

## ICC II Lab8

  - `set_clock_balance_points -balance_points ...`
  - CTS-specific cells :: `set_libcell_purpose` power hold optimization
      - **CTSの間はrize/fall transition timeのbalancingが必要であるため、 CTS-only
        bufferが必要になる**
        
        <div class="quate">
        
        When performing CTS, it is generally desirable to use specific
        cells for synthesis, instead ofletting ICC II choose any cell
        from the library, for example: Cells which help to reduce skew
        (identical rise/fall ramp times); Cells which help to better
        balance between power consumption and speed/drive-strength,
        size, etc.

## ICC II Student Guide 9 routing

### Route Operation

  - CTS should have been already done
  - VR :: Virtual Route (CTS phase)
  - GR :: Grobal Route
      - Assigning nets to specific metal layers
      - GRC or Gcells :: global routing cells
      - Avoid congested Gcells / PG / routing blockage
      - Not create metal shapes
  - TA :: Track Assignment
      - attempts to
          - make long, straight traces
          - reduce the number of vias
      - remove global routes or GR vias \> roughly **routed**
  - Detail Routing
      - performs multiple iterations with varying repair box sizes

### Pre-Routing Checks and Setup

  - Check for Routing "Readiness"
      - Routability Check  
        `check_routability`
          - blocked ports, out-of-boundary pins
          - pin access edge rules honored
          - minimum-grid violations
  - Secondary PG Pin :: e.g. backup P/G for always-on cells
      - vs Primary Power/Ground Rail
  - Maximum number of PG pin connections from strap
  - NDRs for Secondary PG Routing
      - specify certain layers/vias and width.
      - tie-off connections :: the router can connect tie-off nets to
        straps, rails, or pins.
  - RVI :: Redundant Vias Insertion
      - DFM  
        Design For Manufacturability
    <!-- end list -->
      - more difficult to converge on the routing design rules and you
        might see a reduction in signal integrity
  - Concurrent Antenna Fixing
      - Layer Jumping/Hopping
      - Antenna role :: specified from fab
  - Routing Guides
      - change default routing behavior
      - `river_routing` ??
  - Routing Blockage
      - Preventing Routing
  - Scope :: By default, the router is allowed to reroute any pre-routed
    nets (e.g. custom-routed bus, unless shape is marked as “user”)
  - To prioritozed Timing-critical nets
      - enabling timing-driven routing
  - Crosstalk Analysis
      - Delta delay  
        <https://www.design-reuse.com/articles/48514/optimization-of-crosstalk-delta-delay-on-clock-nets.html>
      - Timing Window  
        margin
    <!-- end list -->
      - Current recommendation: Enable crosstalk only during track
        assignment
  - Static Noise
      - Noise analysis is enabled with SI
          - Uses CCSN libraries
      - Noise Immunity :: tolerance of a certain amount of noise without
        causing failure at the cells
  - Align between ICC II and PT Settings
      - CCS  
        Composite Current-Source Noise
      - CCSN  
        CCS Noise
      - AWP  
        Advanced Waveform Propagation
  - Timing window calculation is generally turned off by default because
    it incurs a runtime cost.
