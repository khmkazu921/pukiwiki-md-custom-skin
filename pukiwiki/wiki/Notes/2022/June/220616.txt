## DC Libraries

  - generic libraries

  - `target_library` `link_library`

  - `check_design`

  - DDC :: ddc is a synopsys encrypted form of your design which can be
    read by the tools such as Design compiler, IC compiler and prime
    time.

  - Ports :: inputs and outputs of the current design

  - Pins :: the inputs and outputs of any cell
