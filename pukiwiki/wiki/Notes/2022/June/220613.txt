  - ERC vs PERC
  - PERC :: Programmable Electrical Rules Checking (PERC) is a method
    for checking reliability issues of integrated circuit (IC) designs
    that cannot be checked with design rule checking (DRC) or layout
    versus schematic (LVS).
      - Netlist Checks  
        Checks that can be done entirely on a netlist; no layout data is
        necessary.
      - Netlist Driven Layout Checks  
        Checks that are done on the layout, but a preceding analysis of
        a netlist is done to determine the area of interest for the
        layout check.
      - Current Density Checks  
        Checks done on the layout to determine the current carrying
        capability of the layout in the ESD discharge path.
      - Point-to-Point (P2P) Resistance Checks  
        Checks done on the layout to determine the resistance of the ESD
        discharge path, to verify that it is low resistance ensuring the
        current will choose that path.
