## Hold Fixing

  - Hold buffer  
    There are further two categories to it:

  - Buffer cells  
    Buffers which are chosen to fix hold are of low drive strength cells
    so as to provide large delay. Doing this would result in less number
    of buffer usages.

  - Delay cells  
    There is another category of special buffers called as Delay cells
    which generally are used to fix hold with huge magnitude of
    violations. Delay cells have the same functionality as that of a
    buffer but with larger delay, larger area and high power.

## Synthesis

### Standard cell

  - Cell height
  - Cell width
  - Voltage rails
  - Well definition
  - Pin Placement
  - PR Boundary
  - Metal layers
      - Ideally, Standard Cells should be routed entirely in M1

### Functions

  - Combinational logic cells (NAND, NOR, INV, etc.)
      - Variety of drive strengths for all cells.
      - Complex cells (AOI, OAI, etc.)
      - Fan-In \<= 4
      - ECO Cells
  - Buffers/Inverters
      - Larger variety of drive strengths.
      - “Clock cells” with balanced rise and fall delays.
      - Delay cells
      - Level Shifters
  - Sequential Cells:
      - Many types of flip flops: pos/negedge, set/reset, Q/QB, enable
      - Latches
      - Integrated Clock Gating cells
      - Scan enabled cells for ATPG.
  - Physical Cells
      - Fillers, Tap cells, Antennas, DeCaps, EndCaps, Tie Cells

### Voltage

  - Multiple Drive Strength
      - Each cell will have various sized output stages.
    
      - Larger output stage =\> better at driving fanouts/loads.
    
      - Smaller drive strength =\> less area, leakage, input cap.
    
      - Often called X2, X3, or D2, D3, etc.
    
      - Drive strength is the capacity of a cell to drive a value to the
        cell connected to its output. Different sizes of std cells have
        different capacitance, smaller cells have small capacitance and
        vice versa. Its easier to drive a small cell than a large one.
        The load connected at the output of a cell is the combined
        capacitance of all the cells connected at the output. So larger
        the load, larger is the drive required to "force" the values at
        the output.
        
          - From another point of view, it is just the strength required
            to charge/discharge the capacitance at the output to the
            required value. Greater the drive strength, higher current
            can be drawn from the supply and the output capacitors can
            be charged quickly, if drive strength is low, then the
            current is less and the output capacitance takes time to
            charge/discharge.
        
          - Hence the fanout of a cell is usually kept low to avoid
            driving problems.

### Sequentials

  - Flip Flops and Latches, including
      - Positive/Negative Edge Triggered Synchronous/Asynchronous
        Reset/Set Q/QB Outputs Enable Scan etc., etc

## Signoff

### Electromigration Analysis

  - Check current density.
  - Focuses on power lines, but "Signal EM" is also required nowadays.

### Layout vs Schematic (LVS)

1.  Extract layout (GDS) & build SPICE netlist
2.  Export Verilog and translate into Spice netlist

<!-- end list -->

  - Compare the two

### Electrical Rule Check (ERC)

  - Part of LVS
  - Checks for shorts, floating nets, well biasing
