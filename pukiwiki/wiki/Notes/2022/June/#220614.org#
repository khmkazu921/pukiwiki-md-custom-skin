* Status Meeting
- Poly registance :: hold 
- ZSR1 :: save company resources

** PrimeTime HyperSacale
- ETM 
- flat analysis runs 1 large design
- HyperScale analysis runs some small designs
- benefit 
  - Many corners need more database.
- bottom-up flow
  - runtime & database file size is not large
  - README is important
- *Traditionally, Hold is fixed when Top design. But Hyperscale
  enables hold fixing at Block design*
- MIM :: Multiple Instantiated Modules

- top-down flow
  - set_input_delay = ignored
  - context model :: GBA
- SPEF :: Standard Parasitic Exchange Format, RC delay
- back-annotation :: The process of updating the logical design of a
  circuit with physically measured values, to allow for more accurate
  simulation. 回路の論理設計を物理的に測定された値で更新し、より正確な
  シミュレーションを可能にするプロセス。

** Question
- Disadvantage
  - No use in signoff, currently.
- top down flow (top-down)
  - After finishing design, to more accurate design
- Block からの解析はGBA ?
- Top からの解析はPBA


* Self Study

** I/O
- clamp cells :: also refers as isolation cells

- Clamp (supply) cell is ESD protection cell also, but typically it is
  used at supply rails. It should clamp ESD spikes only (!) to safety
  levels. ESD protection cell should be included in every IO, and in
  general it clamps ESD spikes in some manner.

- Diode clamps 
  - Diodes turn on if pad voltage: 
    - Exceeds VDD +0.7V
    - Drops below VDD -0.7V 
  - P+ diffusion in n-well
  - N+ diffusion in p-substrate

- I/Os 
Power supply noise
- Power Supply has 4 kinds
  - VDD / VSS / VDDIO / VSSIO

- SSO :: Simultaneously Switching Outputs
  - A metric describing the period of time during which the switching
    starts and finishes.

- Design Guideline
  - Put as many mutual capacitances as possible between IC supply
    voltages
    - Maybe it is to avoid capacitance coupling and noise generation.
  - Put as many supply voltage pins as possible.
  - Put supply and ground supply voltages as close to each other as
    possible.
  - Provide separate supply voltages for the core and I/Os.
  - Reduce inductances as much as possible by using as short
    transmission lines as possible.
  - Reduce signal rate as much as possible. But be careful as the
    reduction of signal rate leads to signal weakening, and
    experiments show that those noises can have definite affect on the
    given I/O cells.

  - Coupling between lines can be:
    - electrostatic :: capacitive coupling due to the stray
      (parasitic) capacitance
    - electromagnetic :: inductive coupling resulting from the mutual
      inductance

  - Mutual Capacitance : 「相互容量方式」は、送信電極と受信電極を用いて
    電界を発生させ、送受信電極間の電界変化を検出します。
  - Self Capacitance : 「自己容量方式」は、単一の電極と人体（指先）との
    間の静電容量を検知して、タッチ状態かそうでないかを判断します。


Pad Configurations

** Placement & Optimization
*** Power Optimization
*** QoR Setup
- Congestion Aware Placement
  - keepout margins and/or placement blockages
  - cell and pin density
  - Layer aware
  - CDR :: Congestion Driven Restructuring
- Timing-aware Setup
  - Restructuring :: Restructuring of logic for power reduction
  
- BAP :: Buffering Aware Placement

- ICG optimization
  - Trial-CTS
- Clock-Aware Placement
- Power and Area Focused Setup
  - Route-Driven Extraction (RDE)
    - RDE use s global routing
- Preroute Optimization
- Dynamic power-driven placement


*** NDM (New Data Model / Milkeyway Library)
- NDM cell library contains
  - Timing and Frame views
  - Design and Layout views optionally

*** technology library vs file
- If using a technology library, you should ensurethat it contains all
  information that was discussed in the NDM unit
- If using a technologyfile, you need to apply TLU+, site and routing
  track information in ICC If:

- Scan Chain
- Connect PG pins / Tie-high/low cells

*** MCMM


*** Timing Sanity Check
*** ZIC (zero-interconnect) timing analysis
- Do placement after timing sanity check or ZIC timing analysis
- is to ensure thatthenetlist has a chance at meeting timing after the
  design is placed and routed.
- set RC parasitics of long path to zero
- Large violations will most likely NOT be fixed by ICC II, so the
  problem must be addressed before beginning placement.
- Large ZIC timing violations can probably be ignored if they occur on
  non-ideal HFN, or in scenarios that were not used during synthesis.

** Ratioed Logic
- Ratioed Logic is an attempt to reduce the number of transistors
  required to implement a given logic function, waiving the assurance
  of functionality.
- レシオド・ロジックは、ある論理機能を実現するために必要なトランジスタ
  の数を、機能の保証を放棄して減らそうとするものである。
