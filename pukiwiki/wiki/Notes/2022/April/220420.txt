## DPM, Design Project Manager

## GPFN2

  - layout repeats iterating operation
  - layout of blocks can be modified ??
  - **substrate manufacturing needs longer time than wafer
    manufacturing**
  - capacitance :: the ratio of the amount of electric charge stored on
    a conductor to a difference in electric potentia
  - PO :: Purchase Order

# Self Study

## [Virtual Clock](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-need-virtual-clock-in-VLSI-during-timing-analysis)

  - During timing analysis, you need to check timing on IO ports as well
    as they actually come from a flop in some other block to current
    block in which you are analyzing timing. So **to model the clock
    latency and clock relationship in other block** we need virtual
    clock.
