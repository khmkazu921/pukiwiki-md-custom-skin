## IO-ring Design (柯さん)

  - [IO ring](https://semiengineering.com/tag/io-ring/)  
    If any incoming signal has a voltage level higher than the core
    level and that signal reaches the core, a core failure may occur

  - WLCSP (Wafer Level Chip Scale Package)

  - [RDL](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/redistribution-layers-rdls/)
    nets :: Redistribution layer, an extra metal layer on an integrated
    circuit that makes its I/O pads available in other locations of the
    chip. An extra layer of wiring on the chip that enables you to bond
    out from different locations on the chip, making chip-to-chip
    bonding simpler.
