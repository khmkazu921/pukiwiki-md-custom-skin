## Unit5

  - CSA Transformations  
    Carry Save Adder (CSA) tree result in the most efficient arithmetic
    circuit; smaller and faster.

  - Boundary optimization  
    propagates constants, unconnected pins, and complement information
    to reduce delay and/or area. It may eliminate output ports and
    invert input port signals.
    
      - invert

  - Design Partitioning  
    sub-designs are defined by module

<!-- end list -->

  - Auto shift reg insertion
      - Scan-FFs are not always necessary because normal ffs can
        propagate Scan-FF's state.
  - Recon
      - timing violation is acceptable before implementation

## Unit8

  - NLO  
    Net Layer Optimization

<!-- end list -->

  - Lookup table logic (coded as case statements) can create highly
    connected sub graphs in the netlist with its many-to-many mapping
    topology.
  - AOI :: and-or-invert logic
  - Synthesis can enable congestion heat map \!
  - Global Routing :: a coarse-grain assignment of routes
      - GRCs  
        “global routing cells”
    <!-- end list -->
      - It first partitions the routing region into tiles/rectangle
        called global routing cells (gcells)
      - It decides tile-to-tile paths for all nets while attempting to
        optimize some given objective function (e.g., total wire length
        and circuit timing).
      - But it doesn’t make actual connections or assign nets to
        specific paths within the routing regions.
      - By default, the width of a gcells is same as the height of a
        standard cell and is aligned with the standard cell rows.

GRC edges??

  - 9-17??
  - next 9-25
