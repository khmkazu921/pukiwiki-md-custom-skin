## Sgnal processing & I/F board

  - Mediatek

  - JA2 :: Sony XR Processor

  - TV tuner

## Mediateck

## XR

  - 2x LPDDR4 0.5GB - capacity is required

  - bump ball is missing

  - Image processing
    
      - HDR, 4k up-scaling, T-CON, LED, Speakers

  - TCON LCD Controller :: dual chips

  - LED Controller ::

  - Cross-section reveals thickness of metal layers etc., which is not
    available tech info from TSMC

## Q\&A

  - heatsink  
    power consumption + thermal of chip

<!-- end list -->

  - package is cheaper when thiner

  - D-chip :: dram on chip

  - transister :: basically a single layer

# Tech Forum

## Design Compuler (DC) Graphical

  - Problem  
    no-template, ignore physical information (wire RC, cell placement),
    accuracy v cost

<!-- end list -->

  - DC vs DCG

### Physical Implementation

  - high cost, high accuracu

## DCG : design compiler graphical

  - can constrain utilisation-based floorplan

## Nintendo Process Evaluation

  - HPCP
  - ULP
  - ULL
  - LP

## Design Compiler NXT

  - When setting strict constraint to DC, DC may impose more strict
    constraint than necessary.
      - In that perspective, DCG **DCG may be better**.

## Q\&A

  - DCG is more strict = worse Power & Area
  - DC v DCG may be

# DE Meeting

  - MIM  
    metal-insulator-metal, 絶縁層を金属で挟み込んだ構造をいう。 The capaciters having this
    structure allows faster, larger and more dence cells by small
    register([link](https://xtech.nikkei.com/dm/article/WORD/20060306/114203/)),
    Foundary is not many.

  - Ark SSIO simulation review?

  - SSIO :: Source Synchronous I/O, Source-Synchronous clocking refers
    to a technique used for timing symbols on a digital interface.
    Specifically, it refers to the technique of having the transmitting
    device **send a clock signal along with the data signals**.
