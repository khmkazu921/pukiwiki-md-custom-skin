# DFT (三浦さん)

  - ATE  
    Automatic Test Equipment

  - DUT  
    Design Under Test

  - Functional Test  
    check only function、76% coverage

  - Structural Test  
    connection between cells, only structure

  - Retention  
    [link](https://xtech.nikkei.com/dm/article/WORD/20060311/114647/),
    leak voltage, the action of absorbing and continuing to hold a
    substance

  - SRAM Retention Test  
    want not only to sleep but also to keep data retention mode :: low
    voltage
    
    test で保証すべき

  - RMA  
    Return Merchandise Authorization, 返品保証

<!-- end list -->

  - reduce cost, improve quality & CS & revenue
      - deal as soon as possible
      - trade-off : DFT circuit increases area \> decrease yield 歩留まり
      - the use of general purpose testers
      - burn-in test :: stress test, use of DFT circuit will more stress
  - Oxide breakdown :: SiO2 Gate Oxside accidentaly includes perticle
  - EM :: Electro-migration, current (electron) attack the metal atom =
    migration

## Fault Models

  - fault model enables analysis

`======`

  - Transistor (Switch) Faults – stuck-open – stuck-short
  - Single stuck-at Faults – stuck-at-zero (s-a-0) – stuck-at-one
    (s-a-1)
  - Delay Faults – transition delay – path delay
  - Memory Faults

`=======`

  - Analog Faults

  - Functional Faults – e.g.: processors

  - PLA (Programmable Logic Array) Faults – e.g.: stuck-at, cross-point,
    bridging

  - Iddq :: quiescent, 静的な, difficult because the current level is same
    as others

  - each cell can be classified by **fault class** by an ATPG tool (EDA
    tool)
    
      - Full  
        pins of all cells
    
      - Testable  
        cells after insert DFT circuits
        
          - DT  
            確実に検出
          - Possible detected  
            検出率５０％
    
      - Untestable
        
          - TI  
            Tied, original design stuck-at zero = untestable

  - Transition delay vs Path delay
    
      - transition  
        one spot
      - path  
        multiple spots

## Test Requirement

  - estimated yield
  - Diagnosis Level
      - especially Memory (SRAM, ROM) Faults (which bit? which address?)
  - Tracability
      - write test time to chips

## Yield

  - D0  
    defect density, defined by process

  - n  
    defined by wafer vendor

  - EFR  
    early failure rate

## CLOVER

  - BIST  
    Built-In Self Test

<!-- end list -->

  - I/O test

  - EFUSE :: electrical fuse macros, burn in only once like memory

  - RVT regular VT = SVT standard VT

  - ISO cell :: isolation cell, port isolation buffer vs power
    isolation, symbol looks like AND gate

# Self Study

  - absolute capacitive load
